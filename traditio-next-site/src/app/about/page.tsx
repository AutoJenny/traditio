      <p className="font-body text-lg text-sand mb-8">
        Welcome to <span className="font-bold text-espresso">Traditio Interiors</span> — a celebration of beautifully curated interiors and timeless pieces, steeped in heritage and heart.
      </p>
      <p className="font-body text-base text-sand mb-6">
        Founded in Edinburgh and rooted in a deep appreciation for craftsmanship, history, and design, Traditio Interiors is the brainchild of <span className="font-semibold text-espresso">Megan Alexandra</span>, whose unexpected journey into the world of antiques began while studying law at university. Megan found herself irresistibly drawn to Edinburgh's antique shops, flea markets, and auction houses. What started as a quiet hobby — restoring old furniture in her student flat and scouring stalls for forgotten gems — quickly evolved into a true passion.
      </p>
      <p className="font-body text-base text-sand mb-6">
        Today Megan divides her time between this passion and the law, driven by a vision to blend traditional antiques with thoughtful, elegant design. In 2019, Traditio Interiors was born. From humble beginnings — selling a few lovingly restored pieces online — the business has grown steadily, built on trust, taste, and an unshakable commitment to quality.

        Now, in 2025, we are proud to unveil our brand new website, reflecting our evolution and showcasing a wider selection than ever before. Whether you're seeking a singular, character-filled piece or looking to furnish an entire space with soul and style, Traditio Interiors offers a carefully considered collection of furniture, lighting, textiles, and decorative objects. Everything we source is chosen with an eye for authenticity, beauty, and longevity — pieces that tell stories and stand the test of time.
      </p>
      <p className="font-body text-base text-sand mb-6">
        Our approach is simple: we love what we do, and we believe in going the extra mile. Whether you're a first-time buyer or a seasoned collector, we are here to help — with advice, sourcing, styling, and a genuine enthusiasm for finding the perfect fit for your home. If we don't have what you're looking for, we'll do our best to find it. And if you're unsure where to start, we'll walk you through it, every step of the way.
      </p>
      <p className="font-body text-base text-sand mb-6">
        From grand Georgian pieces to mid-century gems, Traditio Interiors is as much about preserving history as it is about creating beautiful, liveable spaces today. Based in the heart of Edinburgh, we are inspired daily by the city's rich architectural and cultural tapestry — and we aim to reflect that in every room we help shape.
