[2024-05-13] Fixed bug in PUT handler for products: sanitized categoryIds to filter out null/invalid values before updating categories, preventing Prisma errors and failed updates.

[2024-05-18  DELETE handler for product soft-delete] Added DELETE handler to src/app/api/products/[slug]/route.ts to support soft-deleting products by setting status to 'deleted'. 

[2024-05-18  await context.params fix] Updated all handlers in src/app/api/products/[slug]/route.ts to use 'const { params } = await context;' and 'const slug = params.slug;' as required by Next.js 15+ dynamic API routes. 

[2025-05-13 admin delete refactor] Refactored admin product edit page: delete button is now a prominent trash icon outside the form, ensuring it always sends DELETE and never triggers a PUT. 

[YYYY-MM-DD] Admin UI: Edit button is now a blue button, Delete is a trash icon button that sends a DELETE request to the API (not a PUT). Ensured delete is distinct and works as expected. UI and API behavior now match requirements. 

[YYYY-MM-DD] Admin product list: Edit button is now a small blue circle with a pen icon instead of text.
