[INIT] Created Traditio Site Build Checklist in /docs/plans/traditio_site_build_checklist.md to guide the staged implementation of the new site based on the style guide and reference design. 

[STEP] Checked off Project Setup items: Tailwind CSS custom config, Google Fonts for Playfair Display and Inter, and base global styles in /docs/plans/traditio_site_build_checklist.md. 

[STEP] Checked off 'Create main layout component (max-width, padding, grid, whitespace)' in /docs/plans/traditio_site_build_checklist.md. 

[STEP] Checked off 'Implement sticky top navigation bar' and 'Place logo (images/site/traditio_logo.png) left' in /docs/plans/traditio_site_build_checklist.md. 

[STEP] Checked off 'Add minimal navigation links right' in /docs/plans/traditio_site_build_checklist.md.

[STEP] Refactored build checklist: now enforces analysis/documentation before implementation for every section, in optimal order. Updated style guide for pixel-perfect modants.co.uk clone. All instructions are now explicit for new coders.

[STEP] Completed and documented global layout & structure analysis of modants.co.uk in the style guide as required by the new checklist process.

[STEP] Replaced <img> with Next.js <Image> for the logo in layout.tsx and page.tsx to enable image optimization and lazy loading, as required by the build checklist and style guide.

[STEP] Implemented top navigation and footer in layout.tsx per the style guide and checklist. Checked off these items in the build checklist.
